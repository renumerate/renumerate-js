description: Get started with Renumerate JS - AI-powered retention for subscription businesses
---

Renumerate JS is a powerful JavaScript library that helps subscription businesses reduce churn through AI-powered retention workflows.

## Installation

Install the Renumerate JS library using npm:

```bash
npm install @renumerate/js
```

## What is Renumerate?

Renumerate provides two main solutions for subscription retention:

### Subscription Hub
The **all-in-one proactive retention solution** that gives customers offers before they even think about canceling. The Subscription Hub eliminates all the headaches of managing Stripe integrations and allows users to fully manage their subscription including:

- View billing history and invoices
- Update payment methods
- Change subscription plans
- Pause or cancel subscriptions (with retention offers)
- Apply promo codes and discounts

This is a complete customer portal that you can embed directly into your application.

### Retention Flow (Cancel Button)
The **bite-sized quick integration** that pops up the cancellation flow when a user clicks cancel. This is perfect for adding to your existing subscription management portal - just replace your current cancel button with Renumerate's intelligent cancel button that presents retention offers before processing the cancellation.
